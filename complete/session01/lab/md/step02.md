#Code Editor

You are a developer so you've more than likely already got your favourite code editor.


- ![](http://www.vim.org/images/vim_header.gif) [VIM](http://www.vim.org) You are a minimalist at heart, but you value raw power
- ![](http://www.emacswiki.org/pics/static/EmacsSplashScreen.png) [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) You wanted the most powerful, and most extensible editor on Earth, and you can write a formal mathematical proof that Emacs is that editor
- [Nano](http://www.nano-editor.org/) All you need is a working text editor. And Pico/Nano is just that. No frills, no bells, no whistles. Just rock solid functionality.
- ![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Notepad%2B%2B_Logo.png) [Nodepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) You like the simplicity of Notepad, but you wanted a bit more.

This code lab has mainly HTML5 and Javascript code editing.
